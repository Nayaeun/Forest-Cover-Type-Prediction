# Forest Cover Type Prediction

## Introduction
This repository encapsulates the culmination of efforts in predicting forest cover types using machine learning algorithms. Forests play a pivotal role in the health of our planet, and understanding and managing them becomes imperative in the face of climate change and deforestation.

## Objectives
The primary objectives of this project are as follows:

* To accurately predict the seven different forest cover types in a specific area.
* To evaluate and compare the performance of machine learning models, including Random Forest, K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP), and Decision Tree.
* To identify the most influential environmental features affecting forest cover types.
* To contribute insights into the ecological factors influencing the distribution of different forest cover types.

## Methodology
The approach to achieving these objectives involved a comprehensive methodology:

1. Data Collection:
Acquired a dataset containing 15,120 observations and 56 features with information on topography, soil type, and other environmental factors.

2. Data Preprocessing and EDA:
Conducted extensive data preprocessing to ensure quality and suitability for analysis.
Explored the dataset through visualizations, including correlation heatmaps and pair plots, to uncover relationships between features.

3. Model Development:
Trained and tested machine learning models, such as Random Forest, KNN, MLP, and Decision Tree.
Employed GridSearchCV for hyperparameter tuning to optimize model performance.

4. Evaluation and Validation:
Evaluated model performance using metrics like F1 score, selecting Random Forest as the optimal model.
Deployed the selected model for predictions and achieved a Kaggle score of 0.74.


## Results
The project yielded the following notable results:
* Random Forest emerged as the top-performing model with an F1 score of 0.86.
* Visualization techniques provided insights into the relationships between features, contributing to a deeper understanding of ecological factors.
