# Forest Cover Type Prediction

## Introduction
Forests are vital ecosystems, playing a crucial role in maintaining biodiversity, regulating climate patterns, and providing habitats for various species. With the increasing threats of climate change and deforestation, understanding and managing forest cover types have become imperative. Accurate identification and prediction of forest cover types are essential for effective conservation strategies and ecosystem management. In this study, we aim to predict seven different forest cover types using machine learning algorithms.

## Objectives
1) To develop predictive models for forest cover types using machine learning algorithms.
2) To evaluate the performance of different machine learning models in predicting forest cover types.
3) To identify the most important features influencing the distribution of forest cover types.
4) To gain insights into the ecological factors associated with different forest cover types.

## Methodology
### Data Collection and Preprocessing:
* Acquired a comprehensive dataset containing various features such as elevation, slope, soil types, and wilderness areas.
* Employed outlier removal techniques using Z-score method to enhance model robustness.
* Conducted feature scaling to standardize features for fair treatment during model training.
* Split the dataset into training and testing sets to evaluate model generalization.

### Feature Engineering and Selection:
* Expanded feature space through linear combinations, Euclidean distances, and mean values.
* Applied logarithm and square root transformations to capture non-linear relationships.
* Evaluated Pearson coefficients to identify and retain features with strong correlations.
* Implemented feature selection strategies to mitigate multicollinearity issues.

### Model Selection and Training:
* Selected a diverse set of machine learning models including Random Forest, K-Nearest Neighbors, Extra Gradient Boosting (XGBoost), Extra Trees, and Decision Tree.
* Utilized default parameters for initial model evaluation.
* Fine-tuned models using RandomizedSearchCV and GridSearchCV to optimize hyperparameters.
* Employed K-fold Cross Validation to assess model performance and mitigate overfitting.


## Results
* Identified Extra Random Forests as the best-performing model with an accuracy score of 0.8865.
* Achieved an 89% accuracy rate in forest cover type classification, emphasizing the significance of feature engineering and selection.
* Highlighted the importance of specific features such as elevation, soil type, and geographical characteristics in predicting forest cover types.
* Observed distinctive preferences of forest types across different wilderness areas, providing valuable insights for ecosystem management.

## Conclusion
In conclusion, our study demonstrates the effectiveness of machine learning models in predicting forest cover types. Through rigorous feature engineering, model selection, and hyperparameter tuning, we achieved high accuracy rates and gained valuable insights into the ecological factors influencing forest distributions. The findings from this study can inform conservation efforts, land management strategies, and ecosystem preservation initiatives, contributing to the sustainable management of forest ecosystems in the face of environmental challenges.
